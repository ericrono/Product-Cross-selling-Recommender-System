# Financial Investment Product Recommender-System
## Overview
This project aims to develop a recommendation system to enhance product offerings for both new and existing customers. For existing customers, the system focuses on cross-selling and upselling by utilizing data on their geographic location, demographics, and investment behaviors to recommend products that match their profile. For new customers, recommendations are tailored to their specific needs, including factors such as risk appetite, investment duration, and investment amount. The recommendation engine is designed to be user-friendly and highly effective in identifying investment products that best align with each customer's unique characteristics.

### 1. Getting Started
This section sets up the environment, loads necessary libraries, and prepares the workspace for analysis. Libraries used here are for data manipulation,numerical operations, data visualization and Modelling.

### 2. Data Loading and Exploration
Here, the notebook loads the customer profile and investment product datasets, performs an initial examination of their structure, and displays key attributes. The focus is on understanding the available fields, which include:
- **Investor Age**: Age of the investor.
- **Town**: Investor's town or location.
- **Beneficiary Age**: Age of any associated beneficiaries.
- **Product Portfolio**: Information about available investment products.


**Key steps**:
- Load the data using `pd.read_csv` or similar methods.
- Display the first few rows using `head()` to get an overview.
- Check for missing values and datatype consistency.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
This section cleans and prepares the data for further analysis. Typical preprocessing steps include:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or dropping missing values to ensure data consistency.
- **Dropping Duplicate Rows**: Dropped replicated rows within our dataset which reduced the number of rows from about 7.5 million to 120,000.
- **Mapped Columns**: Mapped Relationship,Gender and Portfolio Columns.
- **Calculated Ages**: Using Members and Beneficiary Date of Birth we calculated their current age.


### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA section, the notebook examines relationships within the data, especially focusing on:
- **Age Distributions**: Age distribution of investors and beneficiaries.
- **Town Distribution**: Count of investors per town.
- **Investment Product Preferences**: Analysis of the most popular products by age group.

The notebook uses bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize these relationships, providing insights into potential cross-selling opportunities based on demographic patterns.

### 5. Feature Engineering
The notebook creates new features that may improve the recommendation model, such as:
- **Age Grouping**: Categorizing investors into age groups (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior).
- **Beneficiary Status**: Creating a binary variable indicating whether an investor has a beneficiary.
- **Regional Grouping**: If there are multiple towns, grouping them by similar regions might improve recommendation specificity.

### 6. Recommendation System
This is the core section where the recommendation system is designed. The system is composed of:
- **Rule-Based Recommendations**: Based on predefined rules, specific products are suggested to certain age groups.
- **Pattern-Based Recommendations**: Analyzing past investment choices to make data-driven recommendations.

The notebook also implements:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  to suggest products similar to the investorâ€™s previous choices.
- **Rule-based Logic**: Mapping specific age ranges to recommended product types.

Each recommendation function is thoroughly documented, explaining input parameters and the logic behind suggested products.

### 7. Evaluation
This section evaluates the recommendation system's performance, using Accuracy Metric.
  
Evaluation also included testing our model using existing customers data and sample customers.


### 8. Conclusion and Next Steps
The notebook concludes with a summary of findings and suggestions for improving the recommendation system, such as:
- Incorporating additional data (e.g., income level).
- Testing alternative recommendation algorithms.
- Fine-tuning rules to improve targeting accuracy.
